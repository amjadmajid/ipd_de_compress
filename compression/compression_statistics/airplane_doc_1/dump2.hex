101 [4910-13-U] DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION  Federal Aviation Administration  14 CFR Part 39 [65 FR 37473 6/15/2000] [Docket No. 98-ANE-66-AD; Amendment 39-11780; AD 2000-12-02] RIN 2120-AA64 Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney PW4000 Series Turbofan Engines  AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.  ACTION: Final rule.  SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Pratt & Whitney PW4000 Series Turbofan Engines, that currently requires revisions nclude required enhanced inspection of selected critical life-limited parts at each piece-part exposure. This action adds additional critical life-limited parts for enhanced inspection. This amendment is prompted by additional focused inspection procedures for other critical life-limited rotating engine parts that have been developed by the manufacturer. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent critical life-limited rotating engine part failure, which could result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the airplane. DATE: Effective September 13, 2000. ADDRESSES: The rulemaking docket may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Regional Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Peter White, Aerospace Engineer, Engine Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803-5299; telephone (781) 238-7128, fax (781) 238-7199.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding (AD) 990815, Amendment 3911121 (64 FR 17947), that is applicable to certain Pratt & Whitney series turbofan engine was published in the Federal Register on October 7, 1999. The original AD required enhanced inspection of selected critical life-limited rotating components in the fan rotor at each piece-part exposure. This amendment will require additional enhanced inspections of selected critical life-limited rotating components in the HPT rotor at each piece-part exposure. New Procedures and Parts Since the issuance of that AD, additional focused inspection procedures for other critical life-limited rotating engine parts have been developed. The new parts are the: 2  High Pressure Turbine (HPT) 1st stage airseal--on certain models   HPT 2nd stage airsealon certain models   HPT 1st stage (front) hub   HPT 2nd stage (rear) hub  airworthiness maintenance program to incorporate these inspection procedures, and will revise the Time Limits Section of the manufacturer's Engine Manual. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the eleven comments received.  Length of comment and inspection periods Two comments express concerns regarding the length of the comment period, and the length of the initial compliance time allowed to incorporate the manufacturer's instructions into an applicant's maintenance plan. One comment asks that the final rule not be issued and the comment period extended until after the manufacturer publishes the new inspection procedures  Another comment asks that the initial compliance time be extended from 30 to 90 days to better  The FAA does not agree. The FAA believes that the nature and scope of the added inspections will not be significantly different from existing inspections. In addition, the effective date of this AD has been extended to 90 days after publication to allow time for the specific procedures to be published. The extra time until the AD becomes effective should also allow the manufacturer to issue a manual revision. Operators may submit comments to the docket file on the specific procedures, once they are published, and the FAA will consider extending the effective date further or additional rulemaking, as necessary. The FAA does not believe, however, that this final rule need be delayed pending the publication of the inspection procedures, or the initial compliance time extended to accommodate the manufacturer's manual revision cycle. More than one engine model covered by AD One comment notes that engine models covered by two different Type Certificates are affected by this AD, and feels that a separate AD should be issued to cover the engine models covered by each Type Certificate. Another comment notes that, to avoid confusion, the tables in proposed paragraph (a) should be divided by engine model. The comment points out that as presently constructed the AD requires information related to different engine models to be incorporated into all manuals. That could cause confusion as information unrelated to a  The FAA does not agree that products covered by different type certificates must be addressed y different type designs in a single AD. When the same unsafe condition exists or is likely to develop on products covered by different type designs, a single AD covering all the affected products works more efficiently than duplicating the same corrective undue burden on operators, and may actually simplify administrative responsibilities by 3 reducing the number of AD's required to be tracked. This AD applies to engines covered by three Type Certificates.  The FAA does agree, however, that the tables in paragraph (a) should be separated by engine model. Paragraph (a) will be changed to include a provision that only the table that applies to a particular engine model should be incorporated into that engeliminate the potential confusion in having information not applicable to that engine in its manual.  HPC parts included in the proposed rule Two comments question the need for this AD noting that the lower risk associated with HPC disk failures make the inclusion of HPC parts in the enhanced inspection program unnecessary. The FAA partially agrees. The failure of an HPC disk with a full webbed bore configuration such as the PW4000 poses a hazard to the aircraft due to the energy associated with these large, heavy, rapidly spinning components. While the risk factors for HPC failures are somewhat lower than those associated with HPT and fan failures, the FAA feels this could be due to several factors, which will need to be evaluated. Until further studies have been completed, the FAA will eliminate the HPC parts from the enhanced inspection program for these engine models. The FAA will continue to review and evaluate the data and will take appropriate action when this review is completed. Part numbers used to identify parts to be inspected One comment notes that the use of specific part numbers (P/N's) to identify the parts needing enhanced inspection raises concerns. The comment notes that the use of part numbers places additional undue burden on operators who must keep track of the manual changes to ensure consistency with P/N's, and creates a need for downstream revisions to the AD as additional part number disks are introduced into service. The FAA concurs. During the process of preparing this rule, the FAA considered utilizing the term "ALL" rather than specific part numbers, but not all part numbers associated with a specific part need enhanced inspection. For example, HPT airseals from various engine models may or may not need enhanced inspection, depending on the configuration of the part. Only those parts that are likely to hazard the aircraft by their failure are included in the enhanced inspection program. Therefore, the "ALL" terminology could not be used consistently across engine models. However, in response to another comment the FAA is changing the structure of this AD to separate the tables by engine model. With that change each table may use the term "ALL" and eliminate the need for specific P/N's.  Discussion section changed from original NPRM One comment notes that the preamble published with this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NRPM) did not include the same guidelines concerning required enhanced inspections as the preamble for the NPRM published for the current AD. The comment asks that the FAA add those guidelines to the final rule. The FAA does not agree. The inspection program established by the current AD has not been changed. The NPRM proposed to add additional parts to the list of parts that must be inspected, 4 issued to introduce additional intervention strategies in order to further reduce uncontained dd new parts to the list of parts to be inspected. The inspection program established by the current AD will remain unchanged unless specifically changed in a future proposal. Manual references should include revision level and issue date Two comments note that the proposed rule does not reference a specific revision level or issue date of the Clean, Inspect and Repair (CIR) manual. The comments express concern that without a specific manual revision referenced operators will not know if the FAA expects compliance with future revisions to the manual, which may be issued without notice and public comment. For that reason, the comments suggest that the manual references in paragraph (a) include a revision level and issue date. The FAA disagrees. Unlike the typical incorporation by reference, this AD does not require inspections to be accomplished "in accordance with" a specific service document or manual. This AD requires changes to the Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA), and to air carrier operator's maintenance plans, in order to include mandatory inspections. Once included in the ALS, the enhanced inspections become operational limits that must be followed. The manufacturer will update the sections of their manuals to incorporate the inspections, and those changes, as well as any future changes, will be coordinated with the FAA. It is not the intent of this AD, however, to mandate the use of any specific manual revision, but only to require the accomplishment of an enhanced inspection. If the FAA should find it necessary to mandate compliance with a specific future revision of the manual, then the FAA will undertake a new rulemaking action and provide notice and an opportunity for comment. Other corrections One comment notes that the table in proposed paragraph (a) lists CIR manual 51A357 as the manual to use when inspecting HPT first stage hub, P/N 50L761, while that part is only found in CIR manual 51A750. The FAA agrees, and will make that correction in the final rule. One comment points out that detail HPT 1st stage disk P/N 51L901 is referenced in the manufacturer's parts catalog, but is not referenced in the corresponding CIR. The FAA agrees. However, the corresponding assembly P/N is called out in the CIR. The "ALL" reference now utilized in the AD eliminates any issues arising from the Detail versus Assembly P/N reference issue. In addition, the FAA has added the definition of "piece-part opportunity" to (a) (2) to clarify that the disks must be inspected when torn down to either the piece part or part assembly P/N level where the inspection can still be accomplished. One comment notes that paragraph (e) of the proposed rule contains the phrase "of this chapter" following a reference to 121.369 (c) of the Federal Aviation Regulations [14 CFR 121.369 (c)]. The comment asks that this phrase be deleted in the interest of clarity. The FAA agrees, and will make that correction the final rule. Engines Affected by the Ruling One commenter notes the PW4098, PW4090D and PW4090-3 models are not affected by the AD, and questions why they are excluded from the rule. The FAA partially agrees. The PW4098 and PW4090D fan hardware were included in the NPRM, and an explanation for this 5 inclusion is provided in the NPRM. Coincident with the inclusion of this hardware, these two models were included in the Applicability statement. The PW4090-3 engine model was certified at a later date, and was not included in the NPRM. The final rule will be modified to include the PW4090-3 engine model in the Applicability section for completeness, as were the PW4098 and PW4090D. Economic Analysis No comments were received on the economic analysis contained in the proposed rules. The FAA has determined that the annual cost of complying with this AD does not create a significant economic impact on small entities. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. Regulatory Impact This final rule does not have federalism implications, as defined in Executive Order (EO) No. 13132, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  Accordingly, the FAA has not consulted with state authorities prior to publication of this final rule. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a "significant regulatory action" under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a "significant rule" under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket.
